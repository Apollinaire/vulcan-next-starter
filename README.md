## Connect to a Vulcan backend

[If you don't know the awesome GraphQL framework Vulcan, get started here](http://vulcanjs.org/)

In another terminal, run a Vulcan application on `localhost:3001`:

```bash
cd SomeVulcanApp
meteor run --settings settings.json --port 3001
```

Run Vulcan Next Starter development server:

```bash
# We favour Yarn over NPM for commands
NEXT_PUBLIC_GRAPHQL_URI="your-vulcan-server-url" yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
