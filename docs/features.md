## Code architecture and build

###Â Code in `src`

All your code should go into the `/src` directory ([doc](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/src-directory)).

This folder structure is officially supported by Next. It is relevant when you have a lot of development tooling alongside your actual codebase, like we do in Vulcan.

### Package-oriented architecture

The structure of a plugin system of Next is still [under discussion](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/discussions/9133). In the meantime, we strive to provide code as clean as possible, structured in package, so you can easily remove prebundled features.

To do so, we currently use a Webpack config so folders in `packages/@vulcan` can be imported the same way as `node_modules`. `packages/@vulcan/core` can be imported as `import "@vulcan/core"`.
You can reproduce the same behaviour with any other prefix by changing `tsconfig.common.json`

You are not forced to structure your own code as packages though.

### Magic src imports with `~`

Import code in `src` from anywhere by writing `import "~/components/foobar"`.

Relative imports are a huge mess to support. A relative import should never go further than the category it belongs too: `pages` should never have to import `components` using a messy `../../../components/myComponent`.

### Quasi-imorphism

We allow folders and packages to contain an `index.client` or `index.server` file, that will be used at build time depending on the environment.
/!\ You still need to have a bare `index` file alongside those environment specific file. Otherwise TypeScript will complain (see the "Failures and learnings" documentation for more details).

## Cypress for e2e testing

### TypeScript

### No screenshot/videos as a default

### Custom commands, with TypeScript

[Relevant doc](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/tooling/typescript-support.html#Types-for-custom-commands)

You can write JavaScript tests and still enjoy auto-completion of custom commands, thanks to TS [triple slash directives](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/triple-slash-directives.html).

### Code coverage

### Vanilla JS test files (with Eslint rules)
